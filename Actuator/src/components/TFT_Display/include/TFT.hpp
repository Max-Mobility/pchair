/*
 This code displays some fancy graphics on the 320x240 LCD on an ESP-WROVER_KIT
 board. This example demonstrates the use of both spi_device_transmit as well as
 spi_device_queue_trans/spi_device_get_trans_result and pre-transmit callbacks.

 Some info about the ILI9341/ST7789V: It has an C/D line, which is connected to
 a GPIO here. It expects this line to be low for a command and high for data. We
 use a pre-transmit callback here to control that line: every transaction has as
 the user-definable argument the needed state of the D/C line and just before
 the transaction is sent, the callback will set this line to the correct state.
